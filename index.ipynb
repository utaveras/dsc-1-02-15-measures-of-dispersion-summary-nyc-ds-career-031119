    "\n",
    "To truly understand our data, we also need **Measures of Dispersion**, namely, Absolute Deviation, Standard Deviation and Variance. These measures tell us how tightly or loosely clustered around the center our data is, and generally act as a measure of how \"noisy\" our dataset is or isn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll learn about these measures of dispersion, and explore the relationship between them, as well as their relationship with other summary statistics.\n"

    "As a measure of dispersion, the variance is very useful. If the values in the data are spread out, the variance will be a large number. On the other hand, if the values are spread closely around the mean, the variance will be a much smaller number. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are, however, two potential problems with the variance. Firstly, because the deviations of values from the mean are 'squared', this gives more weight to extreme scores. Outliers in the data can also impact variance. Secondly, the variance is not in the same units as the values in our data set. Variance is measured in the units **squared**. This means we cannot directly relate variance value to the values in our data set. \n",

Any other locations between these points can be described in terms of **percentiles**.\n",
